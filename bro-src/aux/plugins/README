A Collection of Plugins for Bro
===============================

This repository contains a set of Bro plugins provided by the Bro
Project, as well as plugins contributed by the Bro community.

These plugins are not part of a standard Bro installation, but can be
built and installed separately (and individually). Please note that
some might be experimental, and they generally also see less testing
due to often depending on non-standard dependencies. Use at your own
risk.
